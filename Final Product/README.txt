This program is a basic Solitaire game.  To start the game, go to Driver.java 
and run the file.  Then, the GUI will open in a new window.  From here, the 
user can play Solitaire per the traditional rules.  In the top left corner are 
the four Foundation piles.  They each have a specific suit, from left to right 
they are: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades.  Click on the Deck to see the 
next card.  When the Deck is empty, the card back image will disappear.  Click 
it again to turn the Waste pile back into the Deck.  You can move cards between
piles by clicking on the top of the first pile and then clicking on the top of 
the destination pile.  One can move cards between the Foundation piles and the 
Tableau (main playing area).  One can also pull cards from the Waste to the 
Tableau or the Foundation.  If a face down card is uncovered in the Tableau,
then click on it to turn it face up.  The game is won when all 13 cards of each
suit are in their respective piles in the Foundation.

The GUI utilizes Java Swing.  This provides the user with an effective visual 
representation of what's happening as they make moves.  The program is written
in Java as that is the language of this course.  It was written using the 
Eclipse IDE but should run with any Java IDE.  

Some features that will hopefully be included in the future:
	A "New Game" button
	An "Undo" button
	A "Hint" button
	Animation or an image when the user has won
	The ability to move a partial pile of face up cards amongst the Tableau
	A medium game difficulty with the traditional 3 card flip
